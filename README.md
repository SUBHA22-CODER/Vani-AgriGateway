# Vani-AgriGateway
Vani-Agri Gateway  AI for the 70% without smartphones. Farmers call a local number to get expert advice on pests, weather, and prices in local dialects.  Key Features:  Voice-First: No internet or literacy needed.  RAG AI: Hyper-local, 95% accurate data.  GSM-Ready: Works on any $10 phone.  Transforming basic phones into smart farming tools.
🌍 The Problem
The Digital Divide: Most Agri-Tech solutions require $200 smartphones and 4G/5G data, excluding 70% of small-scale rural farmers.

Information Gap: Real-time data on pests, weather, and market prices (Mandis) rarely reaches the farmers who need it most.

Literacy Barriers: Complex text-based apps are difficult for non-literate users to navigate.

🚀 Our Solution: "Zero-UI" Innovation
Vani-Agri acts as a 24/7 virtual agronomist reachable via any basic feature phone.

Voice-First: Uses advanced Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to allow farmers to "just talk" to the AI in their local dialect.

RAG-Powered Accuracy: Unlike standard chatbots, our system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fetch live weather, pest-control manuals, and government market prices before responding.

Hardware Agnostic: Works on any $10 mobile phone over a standard cellular connection.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Telephony: Twilio / Exotel API (Handles incoming GSM calls).

Processing: OpenAI Whisper (STT) & Google Cloud TTS (Voice synthesis).

Brain: GPT-4o / Llama 3 (Reasoning and decision support).

Knowledge Base: Vector Database (Pinecone) containing localized agricultural research and Mandi price history.

📈 Impact & Sustainability
Economic: Increases farmer income by providing direct-to-market pricing, eliminating middlemen.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable resource use (water/fertilizer) through precision AI alerts.

Scalable: A single gateway can serve an entire state with minimal infrastructure costs.
