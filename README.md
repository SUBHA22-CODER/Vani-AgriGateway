Vani-AgriGateway is an AI-powered voice platform designed for the 70% of global farmers who live without smartphones or reliable internet. By calling a local number, farmers receive real-time, expert advice on pest control, weather patterns, and market prices in their native dialect.

🌍 The Problem: The Digital Divide
Traditional Agri-Tech solutions often fail the people who need them most due to:

The Hardware Gap: Most apps require $200+ smartphones and 4G/5G data.

The Literacy Barrier: Text-heavy interfaces exclude non-literate rural populations.

The Information Lag: Critical data on Mandi (market) prices and pest outbreaks rarely reaches the "last mile."

🚀 Our Solution: "Zero-UI" Innovation
Vani-AgriGateway provides a 24/7 virtual agronomist accessible via a standard GSM voice call.

Voice-First Interface: Powered by advanced STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech), allowing farmers to "just talk" to the AI.

Hyper-Local RAG: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fetch live, 95% accurate data on local weather and government market prices.

Hardware Agnostic: Works on any basic mobile phone; no internet or app installation required.
